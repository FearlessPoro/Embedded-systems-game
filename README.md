# Embedded-systems-game
A simple game using ARM Cortex M3 with two peripherals: LCD screen(Open1768) and accelerometer(PMOD ACL). The accelerometer was used to control a ball movment on the screen, and the objective was to get the ball to move through a maze without touching the walls. 

The game was made using microvision, and the communication between peripherals and the processor was configured through an SPI.
