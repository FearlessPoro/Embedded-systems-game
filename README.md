# Embedded-systems-game
A simple game using ARM Cortex M3 with two peripherals: LCD screen(Open1768) and accelerometer(PMOD ACL). The accelerometer was used to control a ball movement on the screen, and the objective was to get the ball to move through a maze without touching the walls. 

The game was made using microvision, and the communication between peripherals and the processor was configured through an SPI.

Creating this project was part of embedded systems laboratory classes. Projects were created in pairs.
